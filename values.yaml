      # CSP (Content Security Policy) header
      # CSP allows limiting origins from where resources are allowed to be loaded. This
      # improves security, since it helps to detect and mitigate cross-site scripting
      # and data injection attacks. The default policy of diaspora* allows all third
      # party domains from services that are included in diaspora*, like OEmbed
      # scripts, so you can safely activate it by setting `report_only` to false. If
      # you customized diaspora* (edited templates or added own JS), additional work
      # may be required. You can test the policy with the `report_uri`. Our default CSP
      # does not work with Google analytics or Piwik, because they inject JS code that
      # is blocked by CSP.
